# Description:-

This project was generated using Angular version 18.1.1, with the layout styled using Tailwind CSS. It focuses on creating a responsive design for a Blog Preview Card component. I practiced one-way data binding, using string interpolation for the title and description, and property binding for the image. The card is designed to display essential blog information, including an illustration, blog type, publication date, title, description, and author details. I have attached the live website in the description of this repository.
